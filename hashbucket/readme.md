those .c and .h files is used to complement hash table.
[main.c] is to test the program
[hash_table.h] is to declare some struct and algorithm
[hash_table.c] is to complement those algorithm

one way to implement hash table is using the link or truly use a array of links.

in our hash table, we define that there is no repeat data.
